# Cloud-Projects

I'm currently on an exciting journey to transition into the world of IT as a Cloud Engineer. Starting from the basics, I'm diving deep into cloud technologies, networking, and infrastructure to build a strong foundation. I aim to grow from a beginner to an expert in Cloud Engineering, mastering cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. With each project and certification, I'm honing my skills and getting closer to making a significant career shift into this dynamic field. I'm passionate about learning and eager to bring my knowledge to real-world solutions.

See you on the other side.
