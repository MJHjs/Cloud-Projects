Understanding the path that data packets take to reach their destination is crucial for diagnosing network issues, understanding internet routing, and optimizing network performance.

Example (google.com)

Step 1:

Open Terminal ; traceroute google.com and press enter

traceroute: Warning: google.com has multiple addresses; using 142.250.115.100
traceroute to google.com (142.250.115.100), 64 hops max, 40 byte packets

Step 2: Analyzing the Output:


The output will display a list of 'hops'. Each hop represents a router or gateway that packets pass through on their way to the destination.

From left to right : 1 - "hops" number in the sequence
2 - the IP address of the hop
3 - RTT or Round Trip Time: The round-trip time (RTT) for packets to reach that hop and return to your computer

Summary - What Did We Learn?

Internet Routing Complexity: Demonstrates the multiple intermediate steps a packet takes through different networks to reach its destination.

Network Performance: The RTT times can give you an idea of the latency between your computer and each hop along the path.

Troubleshooting: Identifying where packets are getting delayed or lost can help diagnose network connectivity issues.
